### GYM BRO

#### Description:
This project is a Data Science/Machine Learning approach to help a user determine what exercise they should do next.

#### Objectives:
I want this project to be the foundation of either one of two things.
- SAAS. I think it would be a cool service to offer people to help save them time in the gym
- GymBro. GymBro is an app I've been thinking about building (Details to come). The idea would be similar to SaaS but instead it would be an actual mobile application.
- Use Pose Estimation to track form (start with simple exercise like curls)

More to come!
