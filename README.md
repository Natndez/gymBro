### GYM BRO

#### Look into webscraping here:

#### Description:
This project is a Data Science/Machine Learning approach to help a user determine what exercise they should do next.

#### Objectives:
I want this project to be the foundation of either one of two things.
- SAAS. I think it would be a cool service to offer people to help save them time in the gym
- GymBro. GymBro is an app I've been thinking about building (Details to come). The idea would be similar to SaaS but instead it would be a mobile application.
- Use Pose Estimation to track form (start with simple exercise like curls)

#### GymBro:
- Gym bro is a mobile app idea that i've been thinking of making for a little while.
- Would have a number of handy features
    - Rep counter (idealy would recognize your form and give you live feedback) (pose.ipynb)
    - Workout tracker (Would track what you've done in your workout)
    - GPS walk/run/bike tracking
    - Filtered exercise database that would give you personalized workout suggestions based on goals and current progress (exercises.ipynb)
- Would likely be a React Native application (focused on pose estimation and filtering currently)
